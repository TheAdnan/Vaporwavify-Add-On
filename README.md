# Vaporwavify (Firefox Add-on)

The most aesthetic add-on for firefox there is.

## Installation
The add-on will be submitted to [Mozilla](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) for review, and as soon as they approve the add-on, I'll put a download link here.
Until then, you can use the add-on temporarily:
* Download and clone this repository on your computer
* Open a new tab and open *about:debugging*
* Click on *Load temporary Add-on* and choose any of the files from the repository folder
* A button with the add-on icon (the red trash dove) should appear in the top right, and you can aestheticize your browsing experience.
